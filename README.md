Noise Reduction Techniques Using Different Filters 

Sound is everywhere. In our voices, technology, and daily lives, we are surrounded by objects that create 
different sounds. Our world functions on the transmission of data and communication through signals. Over 
time, our sense of hearing is reduced by the magnitude of these audio signals. Factors like age, genetics, 
and injuries may contribute, but the largest factor of hearing loss is from noise. In telecommunications, 
noise is an inevitable error that disrupts the signals of useful information. It can be controlled and 
minimized, but never eliminated. Noise can distort the shape, frequency, phase, or amplitude of a signal.
Only until recently, many advanced electronics have been capable of filtering out these noises. We use a 
feature called Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which delivers only the desired sounds to our ears. Similar 
technologies help to prevent hearing loss and overall damage to our health. It is relevant to discuss how 
these technologies work and their mathematical significance. 

The Fourier Series is a fundamental concept in our world, used to model any periodic signal in terms of an 
infinite sum of sines and cosines. A Fourier Transform follows a similar approach for non-periodic signals. 
These mathematical concepts open the possibility of many real-life applications like signal processing, 
speech recognition, and noise reduction. This project seeks to investigate how noise reduction is 
implemented by using Fourier theory. The programs use the Discrete Fourier Transform to filter out the 
unwanted frequencies of a digital audio sample.
